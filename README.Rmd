# FuzzyProduction

WORK IN PROGRESS -- EVERYTHING MAY SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGE

Leading example: Assume you want to use AI to extract and characterize all tables from a PDF of a scientific article. You want an HTML version of each table, but also several characterizations and classifications. E.g. detect if the table shows regression results, then detect each separately shown regression and map it to a regression commands in the code of the article's reproduction package.

AI makes errors and some methods may yield systematically better results than others. This package shall guide and help dealing with such fuzzy AI production chains.
  

## Some variable names and terms

### product schema / prod / prod_id

A product schema or short just **product** is essentially an exact specification of the data set that we want to generate. Also relationships between different intermediate products will be described. Example:

```{r}
prods = prod_define(
  prod_define("tab_list",
    descr = "List of article's tables",
    list(
      tabid = schema_str(is_key=TRUE,maxLength = 10),
      otabid = schema_str() # ordered tabid by augmenting numbers with 0s from left
    ),
    keys = "tabid"
  ),
  prod_define("tab_tino",
    descr = "List of article's tables with extracted title and table notes",
    widens = "tab_list",
    list(
      tabtitle = schema_str(maxLength=400),
      tabnotes = schema_str(maxLength=2000)
    )
  )
)
```


### Production process / proc / proc_id

The writes R functions to specify a process to generate a particular version of a product, i.e. a data set that satisfies the product specification. One can often think of many candidate processes for a product, e.g. different AI models, various prompts, or heuristics.

FuzzyProduction contains several helper function for production processes. For example, dealing with the fact that AI calls may not always work, e.g. to due rate limits. Incomplete process runs can be cached and completed another time.

### product version / ver / ver_id

After we run a process for a product, we generate a concrete version of it. Often, objects related to versions have the prefix `ver_`, e.g. we will have unique version ID `ver_id` for every product version. One deviation is that the concrete data frame that adheres to the product specification is often referred to as `prod_df`.

### Directory structure & relation ships between IDs

All information about product versions will be stored in a specific directory structure.

`fp_dir` generally refers to the parent directory

**version**

{ver_dir} = {site_dir}/{prod_id}/{proc_id}/v{ver_ind}

{ver_id} = {prod_id}-{proc_id}--v{ver_ind}

{ver_ind} is just an integer. If we only want a single version per process we will set `ver_ind=0`, if we want multiple versions `ver_ind` starts with 1 and will be automatically incremeneted when another production run takes place. 

**process*

{proc_dir} = {site_dir}/{prod_id}/{proc_id}

There is no strict format for {proc_id}. The exact process labeling depends on the application. But for a given {prod_id} we need to guarantee that every process gets a different label.

**product**

{prod_dir} = {site_dir}/{prod_id}

There is no strict format for {prod_id}, but it should be a valid variable name using only letters, numbers and _.

## Function prefixes

**fp_** General prefix for functions that are not more closely specified.

**pru** Abbreviation for a production run. Will contain most info about a specific production run that shall create a particular product version. Many helper functions start with `pru_` and often take a pru object as first input and also return a pru object. So many pru functions could be piped.

**pai_** A function related to a single production ai call. A production method may involve multiple AI calls, though.
